# IdeologyWatch
Investigating similarities between german politicians and parties, based on parliament speeches. Inspired by one of my projects during my master's studies: [party-closeness-bundestag](https://github.com/t1h0/party-closeness-bundestag).

## Setup

To get started,

1. Create a python 3.11 environment and install requirements from requirements.txt
2. Download `speeches.feather`, `politicians.feather` and `factions.feather` from [Open Discourse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FIKIBO) (Richter et al., 2020) into `./data`.
3. Run project from root folder.

## Current status

This project is a work in progress and for now heavily relies on the machine learning module of my [nomopytools](https://github.com/t1h0/nomopytools).
